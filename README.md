# Tab Sweeper!
## Extension for chromium-based browsers

If you're like me with 50 browser tabs open at all times, then you need Tab Sweeper. With the click of a button, organize all your tabs into groups based on website.

Future update:
Will use AI to smart-group tabs, based on their content rather than just URL.
